# Gastown Workflow Standards

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/gastown-workflow.bead`

Agent organization, implementation roadmap, safety precautions, and quality gates for Gastown development are defined in the gastown-workflow bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Mayor | Architecture, security auditing |
| Agent-Signal | libsignal-service-rs, group management |
| Agent-Freenet | Wasm contracts, ComposableState |
| Agent-Crypto | STARK circuits, HMAC masking |
| Witness | Audit for Signal ID leaks |

## Spike Week Summary (ALL COMPLETE)

| Q | Status | Finding |
|---|--------|---------|
| Q1 | GO | Set-based state with tombstones |
| Q2 | GO | Contract can enforce invariants |
| Q3 | GO | Bridge Removal algorithm |
| Q4 | PARTIAL | Bot-side STARK verification |
| Q5 | GO | On-demand Merkle (0.09ms at 1000) |
| Q6 | COMPLETE | Store outcomes only |

## Quality Gates

Before agent completion: security verified, no unsafe blocks, no cleartext IDs, Freenet state verification maintained.
