# Stroma Core Standards

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/core-standards.bead`

All core architectural principles, naming conventions, documentation standards, key constraints, and trust model foundations are defined in the core standards bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Key Principles (Summary)

- **Anonymity-First**: Never store Signal IDs in cleartext
- **Trust as Emergent Property**: Mutually arising, not centrally managed
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: ZK-SNARKs for all trust verification
- **Stateless Bot**: All state from Freenet, no grace periods

## Trust Standing Formula

```
Standing = Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags
```

Where voucher-flaggers are excluded from BOTH counts (no 2-point swings).
