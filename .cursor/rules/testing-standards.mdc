# Testing Standards for Stroma

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/testing-standards.bead`

Complete TDD workflow, nextest configuration, deterministic testing patterns, security testing requirements, and domain-specific test patterns are defined in the testing-standards bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Key Requirements

- **Framework**: `cargo-nextest`
- **Coverage**: 100% required
- **Determinism**: Fixed seeds, fixed data, mock time
- **Security**: Property-based tests for crypto operations

## TDD Cycle

1. Red: Write failing test
2. Green: Minimal code to pass
3. Refactor: Improve with tests green
4. Repeat

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Non-deterministic tests (random data, real time)
- ❌ Incomplete coverage (missing error paths)
- ❌ Production-like test data (`+15551234567`)
- ❌ Vague test names (`test_hmac`)
