# Security & Quality Guardrails

## Critical Security Constraints

### Anonymity-First Violations (BLOCK)
- ❌ **NEVER** store Signal IDs in cleartext
- ❌ **NEVER** log member identifiers to disk
- ❌ **NEVER** expose social graph structure to external groups (federation)
- ❌ **NEVER** use pre-shared keys for federation
- ❌ **NEVER** use deterministic hashing (must use HMAC with group-secret pepper)
- ❌ **NEVER** retain vetting session data after admission (must be ephemeral)
- ❌ **NEVER** expose relationship content (bot knows topology, not content)

### Memory Safety Violations (BLOCK)
- ❌ **NEVER** leave sensitive buffers in memory after use
- ❌ **NEVER** skip zeroization of cryptographic keys
- ❌ **NEVER** use `unsafe` blocks without explicit security review

### Trust Model Violations (BLOCK)
- ❌ **NEVER** add grace periods for ejection (no 48-hour warnings, no re-verification windows)
- ❌ **NEVER** make trust decisions without Freenet verification
- ❌ **NEVER** bypass ZK-proof verification
- ❌ **NEVER** allow `Standing < 0` to persist (immediate ejection required)
- ❌ **NEVER** allow vouch count < MIN_VOUCH_THRESHOLD (immediate ejection required)
- ❌ **NEVER** use polling for state monitoring (must use real-time stream)
- ❌ **NEVER** admit members with < 2 vouches from independent validators

## Supply Chain Security

### Mandatory Audits
- **Always** run `cargo-deny` before merging
- **Always** run `cargo-crev` for cryptographic verification
- **Always** review dependency changes for security implications

### Dependency Management
- Keep attack surface minimal
- Monitor binary size - significant increases indicate bloat
- Prefer well-audited crates over convenience libraries

## Code Review Checklist

### Before Merging
- [ ] No `unsafe` blocks without security justification
- [ ] No Signal IDs stored in cleartext
- [ ] All sensitive buffers zeroized
- [ ] Freenet state verified before Signal actions
- [ ] ZK-proofs verified for all trust operations
- [ ] No pre-shared keys in codebase
- [ ] `cargo-deny` and `cargo-crev` checks pass

### Gastown-Specific Checks
- [ ] Review Refinery output for unsafe blocks
- [ ] Check git hooks for accidental key commits
- [ ] Monitor Deacon build size reports
- [ ] Verify Beads contain security constraints

## Sandboxing Requirements

### Production Environment
- Bot must run in seccomp sandbox
- Only allow Signal and Freenet node traffic
- Block all other network access
- Static MUSL binary required

## Error Handling Security

### Information Leakage Prevention
- Never log sensitive identifiers
- Never expose internal state in error messages
- Use generic error messages for security-critical failures
- Log security events without revealing member identities

## Testing Security

### Test Data Hygiene
- Never commit test keys or salts to git
- Use deterministic test fixtures (fixed seeds for reproducibility)
- Clean up test data immediately
- Never use production-like identifiers in tests
- Test ephemeral state cleanup (verify data deletion after threshold)
- Test HMAC-based hashing with fixed test pepper

## Architecture Violations (BLOCK)

### Centralization Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **NEVER** introduce centralized trust authority
- ❌ **NEVER** require admin coordination for federation
- ❌ **NEVER** store trust state outside Freenet
- ❌ **NEVER** give operator special privileges beyond service runner role

### State Management Violations
- ❌ **NEVER** make Signal group the source of truth
- ❌ **NEVER** bypass Freenet state verification
- ❌ **NEVER** cache trust decisions locally without verification
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to modify GroupConfig without group vote
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode consensus thresholds (must be in Freenet contract)
- ❌ **NEVER** allow vouches from people outside Stroma group (only Members can vouch)
- ❌ **NEVER** create "waiting room" as separate chat (outside = not in group, binary state)
- ❌ **NEVER** restrict vouching to only Validators (ANY Member can vouch)

## Operator Least Privilege Constraints (BLOCK)

### Operator Privilege Violations
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to manually execute membership changes
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to override group decisions
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to change consensus thresholds unilaterally
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to bypass ejection protocol
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator access to cleartext Signal IDs
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to unilaterally federate groups
- ❌ **NEVER** allow operator to modify GroupConfig without group consensus
- ❌ **NEVER** require operator to manually execute commands (must be automatic)

### Configuration Management
- ✅ **DO** store all configuration in Freenet contract
- ✅ **DO** require group vote for configuration changes (via Signal Polls)
- ✅ **DO** make configuration discoverable via `/mesh config`
- ✅ **DO** log all operator actions to Freenet contract
- ✅ **DO** treat operator as just another member (with service runner duties only)
- ✅ **DO** enforce `config_change_threshold` for all config updates
- ✅ **DO** use Signal Polls for all group decisions (NOT reactions)
- ✅ **DO** implement automatic execution of contract-approved actions

### Audit Requirements
- ✅ **DO** log all operator actions with timestamps (service start/stop/restart only)
- ✅ **DO** make audit trail queryable by any member
- ✅ **DO** verify bot automatically executes only contract-approved actions
- ✅ **DO** flag any attempt to bypass group consensus
- ✅ **DO** ensure operator role is limited to service management only
