# MDC Rule Standards

## Core Principle

MDC rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) must be **minimal and referential**. The canonical source of truth is always a bead file (`.beads/*.bead`).

## Required Structure

```markdown
# Rule Title

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/<name>.bead`

One-sentence summary of what the bead covers.

## Quick Reference
- Only essential quick-lookup items
- Tables or short lists preferred

## Key Principle
One or two sentences capturing the core constraint.
```

## Constraints

- **Maximum**: ~20-30 lines
- **No duplication**: Never copy full content from beads
- **Always link**: First line after title must be `**Canonical Source**`
- **Read the bead**: Agents must read the bead for complete specifications

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Copying entire bead content into MDC
- ❌ MDC without corresponding bead
- ❌ Detailed implementation in MDC (belongs in bead)
- ❌ MDC longer than 50 lines
