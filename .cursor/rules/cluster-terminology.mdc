# Cluster Terminology

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/cluster-terminology.bead`

The critical distinction between internal clusters (within a single group) and external groups (separate Stroma groups) is defined in the cluster-terminology bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Internal Clusters | External Groups |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Scope | Within ONE Signal group | Separate Signal groups |
| Bot Role | Blind Matchmaker | Diplomat (Blind Rendezvous) |
| Purpose | Admission vetting + mesh optimization | Federation |
| Terms | "assessor", "strategic intro", "mesh-building" | "federation", "cross-mesh" |

## Two Internal Matchmaker Functions

| Function | Purpose | Module |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Admission Vetting** | Select cross-cluster assessor to evaluate invitees | `signal/matchmaker.rs` |
| **Mesh Optimization** | Strategic introductions between existing members | `matchmaker/strategic_intro.rs` |

## Terminology Rules

- ✅ "Assessor" for the member selected to evaluate an invitee
- ✅ "Strategic introductions" for mesh-building between existing members
- ✅ "Federation" or "cross-mesh" for external groups
- ❌ NEVER use "federation" for internal operations
- ❌ NEVER use "cluster-linking" for internal MST building
- ❌ NEVER use "selected member" when "assessor" is the correct term (admission context)
