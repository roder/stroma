# Cluster Terminology

## Critical Distinction: Internal vs External

### Internal Clusters (Within Single Stroma Group)
**Definition**: Sub-communities within ONE Stroma Signal group based on social affinities.

**Example:**
- Single Stroma group with 50 members
- "Artist Cluster" (12 members who know each other well)
- "Engineer Cluster" (15 members who know each other well)
- "Activist Cluster" (10 members who know each other well)
- All in the SAME Signal group

**Purpose:** Optimize internal mesh topology for full intersection.

**Bot Role (Blind Matchmaker):**
- Analyze graph to identify clusters
- Suggest strategic introductions across clusters
- Goal: Achieve Minimum Spanning Tree with least new interactions
- Priority 1: Connect Bridges to Validators from different clusters
- Priority 2: Connect Validators across disconnected islands
- Note: ANY Member can vouch, but bot suggests Validators for optimization

**Anonymity Trade-off:**
- Bot knows topology (who has how many vouches, cluster membership)
- Bot does NOT know why relationships exist or relationship content
- Bot uses this to optimize for intersectional mesh

**Node Types (Within Group):**
- **Bridges**: Members with 2 vouches (minimum requirement)
- **Validators**: Members with 3+ vouches (used for optimization)
- **Invitees/Leaf Nodes**: OUTSIDE group (1 vouch, being vetted)

### External Groups (Separate Stroma Groups)
**Definition**: Completely separate Stroma Signal groups, each with their own bot and Freenet contract.

**Example:**
- Stroma Group A (100 members, their own Signal group)
- Stroma Group B (20 members, their own Signal group)
- Separate bots, separate Freenet contracts

**Purpose:** Federation between independent trust networks.

**Bot Role (Diplomat via Blind Rendezvous):**
- Discover other groups anonymously via Shadow Beacon
- Calculate overlap using PSI-CA (no graph structure revealed)
- Propose federation if BidirectionalMin thresholds satisfied
- Facilitate cross-mesh vouching after federation

**Anonymity Guarantee:**
- Bot knows NOTHING about other group's structure
- Only knows: group size, overlap count, threshold
- Complete privacy preservation

## Terminology Rules

### Use "Internal Cluster" for:
- Sub-communities within single Stroma group
- Artist cluster, Engineer cluster, etc.
- Disconnected components within one group
- Islands that need bridging

### Use "External Group" or "Federated Mesh" for:
- Separate Stroma Signal groups
- Group A, Group B, Mesh-A, Mesh-B
- Different bots, different contracts
- Federation candidates

### NEVER Confuse:
- ❌ "Cluster-linking" when referring to internal MST building
- ❌ "Federation" when referring to internal introductions
- ✅ Use "strategic introductions" or "mesh-building" for internal
- ✅ Use "federation" or "cross-mesh" only for external

## Implementation Context

### Internal Cluster Operations
```rust
// Bot CAN analyze graph structure for optimization
fn identify_internal_clusters(graph: &TrustGraph) -> Vec<Cluster> {
    // Knows topology within single group
    // Used for strategic matching
}

fn suggest_strategic_intro(bridge: Hash, graph: &TrustGraph) -> Hash {
    // Select validator from DIFFERENT internal cluster
    // Maximizes intersectional diversity
    // Note: Any Member can vouch, but prefer Validators
}
```

### External Group Operations
```rust
// Bot CANNOT see other group's structure
fn discover_external_groups() -> Vec<GroupContact> {
    // Anonymous discovery via Bloom Filters
    // No knowledge of internal topology
}

fn calculate_federation_viability(
    overlap: usize,
    our_size: usize,
    their_size: usize,
) -> bool {
    // Only knows counts, not identities or relationships
}
```

## Design Principles

### Internal (Blind Matchmaker)
- **Optimization Focus**: Least effort to full intersectional mesh
- **Graph Awareness**: Bot analyzes topology for strategic matching
- **Privacy Boundary**: Bot doesn't know relationship content or reasons
- **Goal**: Every member has ≥2 vouches from different clusters
- **Vouch Permissions**: ANY Member can vouch (not restricted to Validators)
- **Bot Suggestions**: Bot suggests Validators for optimal intersectional diversity

### External (Blind Rendezvous)
- **Privacy Focus**: Complete anonymity, no graph exposure
- **Zero Knowledge**: PSI-CA reveals only overlap count
- **Discovery**: Emergent, based on shared validators
- **Goal**: Federation without revealing social graph structure
