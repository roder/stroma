# Cluster Terminology

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/cluster-terminology.bead`

The critical distinction between internal clusters (within a single group) and external groups (separate Stroma groups) is defined in the cluster-terminology bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Internal Clusters | External Groups |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Scope | Within ONE Signal group | Separate Signal groups |
| Bot Role | Blind Matchmaker | Diplomat (Blind Rendezvous) |
| Purpose | Mesh optimization | Federation |
| Terms | "strategic intro", "mesh-building" | "federation", "cross-mesh" |

## Terminology Rules

- ✅ "Strategic introductions" for internal cluster bridging
- ✅ "Federation" or "cross-mesh" for external groups
- ❌ NEVER use "federation" for internal operations
- ❌ NEVER use "cluster-linking" for internal MST building
