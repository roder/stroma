# Internal Graph Analysis (Blind Matchmaker)

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/blind-matchmaker-dvr.bead`

The Blind Matchmaker algorithm, DVR optimization, strategic introduction matching, and priority algorithms are defined in the blind-matchmaker-dvr bead. Read that file for complete algorithm specifications.

## Scope

This module applies ONLY to analyzing and optimizing the trust graph **within a single Stroma Signal group**. This is distinct from external federation between separate groups.

## Two Distinct Matchmaker Roles (Architecturally Separate)

| Function | Purpose | Module |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Admission Vetting** | Select cross-cluster assessor to evaluate invitees | `signal/matchmaker.rs` |
| **Mesh Optimization** | Strategic introductions between existing members | `matchmaker/strategic_intro.rs` |

Both use the same DVR-optimized selection algorithm but serve different purposes. Do NOT mix code between these modules.

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose**: Build Minimum Spanning Tree of Trust with least new interactions
- **DVR Optimization**: Prioritize creating distinct Validators with non-overlapping voucher sets
- **Priority Order**: DVR optimization → MST fallback → Island bridging
- **Assessor Selection**: For admission, accept exclusion list (members who declined via `/reject-intro`)

## Algorithm Reference

See `docs/ALGORITHMS.md` for complete mathematical foundations, complexity analysis, and worked examples.

## Implementation

Use `petgraph` crate for topology analysis. Performance targets:
- 20 members: < 10ms
- 100 members: < 50ms
- 1000 members: < 500ms
