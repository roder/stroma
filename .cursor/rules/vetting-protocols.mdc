# Vetting Protocols

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/vetting-protocols.bead`

Complete vetting protocols, admission flow, Blind Matchmaker logic, health monitoring, and architectural principles are defined in the vetting-protocols bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Core Invariant

Signal Group = Fully Vetted Members Only

Cross-cluster vouches required:
- Bridge (2 vouches): 2 different clusters
- Validator (3+): min(vouch_count, available_clusters)

## Admission Flow

1. **Invitation**: `/invite @user` (counts as first vouch)
2. **Matching**: Bot selects validator from different cluster
3. **Introduction**: 3-person chat for vetting
4. **Admission**: After 2 cross-cluster vouches verified in Freenet

## Key Principles

- Waiting room = outside Signal group (not separate chat)
- Invitees = 1 vouch, OUTSIDE group
- Bridges = 2 vouches, IN group
- Validators = 3+ vouches, IN group
- ANY Member can vouch
- Immediate ejection when threshold violated
