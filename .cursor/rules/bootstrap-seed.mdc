# Bootstrap & Seed Group

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/bootstrap-seed.bead`

The complete bootstrap protocol, seed group requirements, initialization steps, and post-bootstrap state are defined in the bootstrap-seed bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Key Points

- **Seed Size**: 3 members (creates initial trust triangle)
- **Initial State**: All 3 vouch for each other (each has 2 vouches)
- **Operator Privilege**: Bootstrap is the ONLY time operator adds members manually
- **Post-Bootstrap**: Bot takes full control, operator becomes service runner only

## Bootstrap Flow

1. Operator runs bootstrap command with group name and 3 seed members
2. Bot creates Signal group and Freenet contract
3. Bot establishes mutual vouch triangle
4. Bot takes over - no more manual additions

## Security Notes

- Seed member Signal IDs zeroized after hashing
- All bootstrap actions logged to Freenet contract
- Queryable via `/audit bootstrap`
