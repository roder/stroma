# Bootstrap & Seed Group

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/bootstrap-seed.bead`

The complete bootstrap protocol, seed group requirements, initialization steps, and post-bootstrap state are defined in the bootstrap-seed bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Key Points

- **Seed Size**: 3 members (creates initial trust triangle)
- **Initial State**: All 3 vouch for each other (each has 2 vouches)
- **Member-Initiated**: Bootstrap via Signal commands, NOT operator CLI
- **Post-Bootstrap**: Bot takes full control, operator is service runner only

## Bootstrap Flow (Member-Initiated)

1. Operator runs `stroma link-device` then `stroma run`
2. First seed member sends `/create-group "Group Name"` to bot
3. First seed member adds others via `/add-seed @MemberB`, `/add-seed @MemberC`
4. Bot creates Signal group, Freenet contract, mutual vouch triangle
5. Bot takes over - all future admissions via protocol

## Security Notes

- Seed member Signal IDs zeroized after hashing
- All bootstrap actions logged to Freenet contract
- Queryable via `/audit bootstrap`
