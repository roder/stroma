# Terminology Standards

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/terminology.bead`

All terminology definitions, member roles, trust actions, cluster concepts, and key calculations are defined in the terminology bead. Read that file for complete definitions.

## Quick Reference

When writing documentation, code comments, or user-facing messages:

1. **Read** `.beads/terminology.bead` for correct definitions
2. **Use** the exact phrasing specified there
3. **Update** the bead FIRST if terminology needs to change, then update referencing documents

## Key Terms Quick Reference

- **Assessor**: Member (bridge or validator) selected by Blind Matchmaker to evaluate an invitee. Contacts invitee independently of the bot.
- **Two Blind Matchmaker roles**: Admission Vetting (`signal/matchmaker.rs`) and Mesh Optimization (`matchmaker/strategic_intro.rs`) -- architecturally separate.
- `/reject-intro @invitee`: Assessor declines assessment; bot selects another candidate.

## Consistency Checks

Before committing documentation changes:

```bash
# Check for ambiguous phrasing
rg "2 vouches" --type md  # Should say "2 cross-cluster vouches"
rg "waiting room" --type md  # Should say "invitee (outside group)"
rg "grace period" --type md  # Should not exist
rg "permanent ban" --type md  # Should not exist
rg "3-person chat" --type md --type rs  # Should not exist (bot belongs to ONE group)
rg "selected member" --type md  # Should say "assessor" in admission context
```
