# Documentation Workflow

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/documentation-workflow.bead`

Human-facing documentation (`./docs`) must be reviewed and revised after development is completed, tested, and verified. Read the bead for complete process.

## Quick Reference

| Document | Audience |
|----------|----------|
| `USER-GUIDE.md` | End-users |
| `OPERATOR-GUIDE.md` | Operators |
| `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` | Contributors |
| `ALGORITHMS.md` | Technical auditors |

## Trigger

Documentation review required when:
1. Feature completed and tests passing
2. Security gates verified
3. Change affects UX or architecture

## Key Principle

Beads are source of truth during development. Docs are derived post-development for specific audiences.
