# Git Standards for Stroma

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/git-standards.bead`

Commit message standards, branch management, workflow patterns, and git hooks are defined in the git-standards bead. Read that file for complete specifications.

## Critical Rule

**All commits by Claude MUST include Co-authored-by trailer:**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message title

Description...

Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

## Workflow Summary

1. Review changes: `git diff`
2. Run quality gates: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo nextest run`
3. Stage and commit with Co-authored-by
4. Sync: `git pull --rebase && bd sync && git push`
5. Verify: `git status` shows "up to date"

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Commit without Co-authored-by
- ❌ Commit secrets or Signal IDs
- ❌ Skip quality gates
- ❌ Force push to main
