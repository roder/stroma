# Philosophical Foundations

**Status**: Immutable Architectural Constraint  
**Source**: `.beads/philosophical-foundations.bead`

---

## Central Principle: Paradoxical Unity

Stroma is built on the recognition that **opposing truths coexist**. The system does not resolve tensions between dualities — it **holds space for their ongoing reconciliation**. Balance between opposing forces is what decentralizing power means in practice.

**Key Insight**: The dualities aren't bugs to be eliminated — they're the **generative tension** that makes the system adaptive.

**"Power With" > "Power Over"**: Distribute decision-making across relationships, never concentrate in singular actors.

---

## Core Dualities (MUST Maintain Both Poles)

### 1. Trust vs Anonymity

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Trust | Knowing *who* to trust (relationships are specific) |
| Anonymity | Hiding *who* trusts whom (relationships are obscured) |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- ZK-proofs: "I can prove trust exists without revealing the relationship"
- HMAC hashing: Identities recognizable to system but not recoverable
- Members know their vouchers; external observers see only topology

**Implementation Principle**: Never sacrifice anonymity to make trust "easier." Never sacrifice trust verification to maximize anonymity. The tension is productive.

---

### 2. Inclusion vs Protection

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Inclusion | Low barriers → easier joining → faster growth |
| Protection | High barriers → harder infiltration → more secure |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- Configurable `min_vouch_threshold`: groups choose their equilibrium
- Default of 2 provides baseline security without excessive gatekeeping
- Groups with higher threat models can increase to 3 or 4

**Implementation Principle**: Never hardcode a position on this spectrum. Provide the mechanism for groups to negotiate their own balance via consensus (`/propose stroma min_vouch_threshold`).

---

### 3. Individual Agency vs Collective Integrity

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Individual Agency | Any member can vouch, invite, flag |
| Collective Integrity | No single member can unilaterally admit or eject |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- ANY Member can vouch (Bridges and Validators alike) — individual agency
- 2+ independent vouches required — collective validation
- Standing = Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags — continuous negotiation
- No single action causes 2-point swing — prevents unilateral power

**Implementation Principle**: Individual actions matter, but outcomes emerge from relationships. Never let one member's action determine another's fate alone.

---

### 4. Accountability vs Forgiveness

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Accountability | Violations must have consequences (ejection) |
| Forgiveness | People can change, re-entry must be possible |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- Immediate ejection: no grace periods, consequences are real
- Immediate re-entry path: no cooldowns, no permanent bans
- Fresh start available: secure 2 new vouches from independent Members

**Implementation Principle**: Never add "warnings" or "probation" that soften accountability. Never add "permanent bans" or "cooldowns" that eliminate forgiveness. Hold both: swift consequences AND available redemption.

---

### 5. Fluidity vs Stability

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Fluidity | Membership is temporary permission, continuously earned |
| Stability | The network persists, relationships have continuity |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- Trust is relational and dynamic, not fixed credentials
- But the mesh structure provides stability as individuals flow through
- The network's "Self" persists even as members come and go
- Vouch relationships can transform (trust ↔ distrust via invalidation)

**Implementation Principle**: Never treat membership as permanent entitlement. Never treat the network as merely the sum of current members. The whole exceeds and outlasts its parts.

---

### 6. Autonomy vs Connection

| Pole | What It Requires |
|------|------------------|
| Autonomy | Each group controls its own parameters |
| Connection | Groups benefit from connection to wider networks |

**How Stroma Holds Both**:
- Each group = separate bot, separate contract, separate thresholds
- Federation is opt-in via consensus (`/propose federate`)
- BidirectionalMin: each group applies its *own* threshold to decide
- Federation can dissolve if shared members leave (emergent, not permanent)

**Implementation Principle**: Never force federation. Never prevent it. Groups discover each other organically and choose connection — or don't.

---

## Decision Framework: When Principles Conflict

When dualities conflict with *each other*, apply this hierarchy:

### 1. Protect Irreversible Harms First

**Irreversible** (protect these):
- Anonymity leaks (once exposed, cannot be re-hidden)
- Power centralization (once concentrated, hard to redistribute)
- Trust map seizure (once captured, relationships are known)

**Recoverable** (can sacrifice if needed):
- Slower onboarding (can adjust thresholds later)
- Missed federation (can reconnect later)
- Overly strict barriers (can loosen via consensus)

**Principle**: When forced to choose, sacrifice the recoverable to protect against the irreversible.

### 2. Default Toward Security, Make Tradeoffs Configurable

- Choose secure defaults that protect against the primary threat model
- But ensure groups can adjust via consensus if their context differs
- The system provides protective primitives; groups negotiate their balance

### 3. Align With Feature's Threat Model

| Feature | Primary Threat | Optimize For |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Identity masking | Trust map seizure | Anonymity |
| Vouch verification | Sybil attack | Protection |
| Re-entry path | Permanent exclusion | Forgiveness |
| Federation discovery | Isolation | Connection |
| Ejection protocol | Bad actor persistence | Accountability |

### 4. Document Tradeoffs Explicitly

When a tradeoff is made:
- Note what was sacrificed
- Note why (which threat model justified it)
- Note how it could be revisited (configurability, future work)

---

## Design Tests

### Before Implementation, Ask:

1. **Does this maintain both poles of the relevant duality?**
   - If it resolves tension by eliminating one pole, reconsider

2. **Does this distribute power or concentrate it?**
   - "Power with" means the answer emerges from relationships, not authority

3. **Is this configurable via consensus?**
   - If reasonable groups might want different values, make it configurable

4. **Does this allow transformation?**
   - Relationships should be able to change (vouch → flag, ejection → re-entry)

5. **Does this hold accountability AND forgiveness?**
   - Swift consequences, but redemption available

### Red Flags (Collapsing Tension)

- ❌ "Only Validators can vouch" (collapses toward hierarchy)
- ❌ "Permanent bans for repeated violations" (collapses toward punishment)
- ❌ "Grace period before ejection" (collapses toward permissiveness)
- ❌ "Admin can override consensus" (collapses toward centralization)
- ❌ "Store identities for accountability" (collapses toward surveillance)

### Green Flags (Maintaining Tension)

- ✅ Configurable thresholds via group consensus
- ✅ Immediate ejection + immediate re-entry path
- ✅ Bot executes consensus, doesn't make decisions
- ✅ ZK-proofs verify trust without revealing relationships
- ✅ Standing continuously recalculated (not cached credentials)

---

## Escalation Criteria

**Flag for human review when**:
- Two irreversible harms are in direct conflict
- The threat model is ambiguous or contested
- No configurable middle ground exists
- The decision would set precedent for multiple features

**Principle**: Agents should make clear tradeoffs confidently, but recognize when a decision requires human judgment about values the system can't encode.

## Grounding Quote

> "Creating balance between opposing truths is what decentralizing power is about... and ultimately this project."

The system accepts both poles and creates space for their ongoing reconciliation. That's the foundation everything else builds on.
