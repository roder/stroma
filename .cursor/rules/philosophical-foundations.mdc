# Philosophical Foundations

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/philosophical-foundations.bead`

All core philosophical principles, dualities, decision frameworks, and design tests are defined in the philosophical foundations bead. Read that file for complete guidance.

## Key Principles (Summary)

- **Paradoxical Unity**: Opposing truths coexist; maintain generative tension
- **"Power With" > "Power Over"**: Distribute decision-making across relationships
- **Core Dualities**: Trust vs Anonymity, Inclusion vs Protection, Individual Agency vs Collective Integrity, Accountability vs Forgiveness, Fluidity vs Stability, Autonomy vs Connection

## When to Reference

Before implementing any feature, read the bead to ensure your design:
1. Maintains both poles of relevant dualities
2. Distributes power rather than concentrating it
3. Allows transformation (vouch → flag, ejection → re-entry)
4. Holds accountability AND forgiveness

## Decision Framework

When principles conflict, the bead defines the hierarchy:
1. Protect irreversible harms first
2. Default toward security, make tradeoffs configurable
3. Align with feature's threat model
4. Document tradeoffs explicitly
