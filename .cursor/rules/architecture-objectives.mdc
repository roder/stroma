# Stroma: Architecture & Objectives

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/architecture-objectives.bead`

The complete architecture specification, design philosophy, core modules, trust model, federation model, and architectural constraints are defined in the architecture objectives bead. Read that file for comprehensive details.

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: Stroma (code name) - also known as **Nexus-Mesh Protocol**  
**Type**: Privacy-first, decentralized trust network  
**Architecture**: Rust Static Binary | Signal Protocol | Freenet (Dark) | ZK-Proofs

## Core Objective

Build a scalable trust network that scales by 10²-10³ without revealing the social graph, using Signal for UI, Freenet for state, and ZK-proofs for verification.

## Key Principles

- Trust is an **emergent property** of the mesh
- **Cross-cluster vouching** required for admission
- **Immediate ejection** when trust threshold violated
- **Bot is execute-only** - decisions come from Freenet contract

## Three-Layer Design

1. **Signal**: User interface (commands, polls, PMs)
2. **Rust Bot**: Trust logic (proofs, hashing, enforcement)
3. **Freenet**: Decentralized state (membership, vouches, config)
