# Stroma Terminology (CANONICAL)

**Status**: Reference - All documentation MUST use these definitions
**Created**: 2026-01-28
**Applies To**: All docs, rules, beads, code comments, user-facing messages

## Purpose

This bead is the **single source of truth** for Stroma terminology. All documentation, rules, and code comments MUST use these definitions consistently. When in doubt, reference this file.

## Core Terms

### Group & Network

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Group** | The Signal group — the concrete chat where members communicate | "Join the group", "added to the group" |
| **Network** | The web of trust relationships — who vouches for whom | "Position in the network", "network health" |

**Relationship**: You join the **group** (Signal chat) once you're vouched into the **network** (trust structure). The group is where you interact; the network is why you're trusted.

### Trust Actions

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Vouch** | A personal endorsement — you stake your reputation on someone | "Alice vouched for Bob" |
| **Flag** | The opposite of a vouch — indicates you no longer trust someone | "Carol flagged Dave" |
| **Invite** | The act of initiating someone's vetting; counts as first vouch | "Eve invited Frank" |

### Clusters

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Cluster** | A friend circle within the network — people who know each other from the same social context | "The activist cluster", "same cluster" |
| **Cross-cluster** | From *different* friend circles — required for admission and ongoing membership | "Cross-cluster vouch", "cross-cluster requirement" |
| **Same-cluster** | From the *same* friend circle — does NOT count toward admission | "Same-cluster vouches don't count" |

**How to determine**: Ask "How do the two vouchers know each other?" If they're close friends or from the same social context, they're same-cluster.

### Member Roles

| Term | Definition | Vouch Count | Cluster Requirement | Status |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Invitee** | Person being vetted | 1 vouch | — | OUTSIDE group |
| **Bridge** | Minimum-requirement member | 2 vouches | 2 clusters | IN group |
| **Validator** | Well-connected member | 3+ vouches | 3+ clusters* | IN group |

*****Cluster requirement scales with vouch count**: Validators need vouches from as many distinct clusters as their vouch count (up to available clusters). If only 2 clusters exist, a 3-vouch Validator needs both clusters represented.

**Note**: Validators have NO special permissions — only higher resilience and bot optimization preferences.

### Trust Calculations

| Term | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **All Vouchers** | Set of members who vouched for you | — |
| **All Flaggers** | Set of members who flagged you | — |
| **Voucher-Flaggers** | Members who both vouched AND flagged (contradictory) | All_Vouchers ∩ All_Flaggers |
| **Effective Vouches** | Vouches that count (excludes voucher-flaggers) | \|All_Vouchers\| - \|Voucher_Flaggers\| |
| **Regular Flags** | Flags from non-vouchers | \|All_Flaggers\| - \|Voucher_Flaggers\| |
| **Standing** | Your trust score | Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags |

### Thresholds & Requirements

| Term | Definition | Default |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Cross-cluster minimum** | Must maintain vouches from as many clusters as vouch count (up to available) | min(vouches, clusters) |
| **Min vouch threshold** | Minimum effective vouches to stay in group | 2 vouches |
| **Standing threshold** | Minimum standing to stay in group | ≥ 0 |

**Scaling rule**: A member with N vouches should have vouches from min(N, available_clusters) distinct clusters.

### Network Health Metrics

| Term | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Distinct Validator** | Validator whose voucher set doesn't overlap with other selected Validators | Greedy selection |
| **DVR (Distinct Validator Ratio)** | Primary health metric — fraction of max possible distinct Validators | Distinct_Validators / (N / 4) |
| **Max Possible Distinct** | Maximum distinct Validators for network size N | floor(N / 4) |

### Health Status (Three-Tier)

| Status | DVR Range | Color | Bot Behavior |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Unhealthy** | 0% - 33% | 🔴 | Actively suggest cross-cluster introductions |
| **Developing** | 33% - 66% | 🟡 | Suggest improvements opportunistically |
| **Healthy** | 66% - 100% | 🟢 | Maintenance mode |

**See**: `.beads/mesh-health-metric.bead` for full rationale

### Ejection Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Standing violation** | Standing < 0 | Immediate ejection |
| **Vouch violation** | Effective vouches < min_vouch_threshold | Immediate ejection |
| **Cross-cluster violation** | Vouches from < 2 clusters (when 2+ clusters exist) | Immediate ejection |

### Special Cases

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Bootstrap exception** | First 3-5 members exempt from cross-cluster (only 1 cluster exists) |
| **Vouch invalidation** | When a voucher flags someone, their vouch is invalidated |
| **Re-entry** | Ejected members can re-join by getting 2 new cross-cluster vouches |

### Bot Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Protocol Gatekeeper** | Enforces 2 cross-cluster vouch requirement |
| **Blind Matchmaker** | Suggests strategic cross-cluster introductions |
| **Health Monitor** | Continuously checks trust standing via state stream |
| **Diplomat** | Discovers and proposes federation (Phase 4+) |

### Federation Terms (Phase 4+)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Federation** | Two groups connecting to share trust |
| **Overlap** | Members who are in both groups |
| **BidirectionalMin** | Each group applies its own threshold to decide |
| **Shadow Vouch** | Member from federated group vouches for invitee |

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT USE)

| Wrong | Correct | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| "Admin" | "Member" or "Validator" | No hierarchy — all members equal |
| "Approved" | "Vouched" | Trust is relational, not granted |
| "Waiting room" | "Invitee (outside group)" | Binary state, not a separate space |
| "Grace period" | — | No grace periods — ejection is immediate |
| "Permanent ban" | "Ejected (can re-enter)" | No permanence — re-entry always possible |
| "Independent members" | "Members in different clusters" | Cross-cluster is the requirement |
| "Two vouches" | "Two cross-cluster vouches" | Must specify cross-cluster |
