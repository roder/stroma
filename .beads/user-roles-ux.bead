**Status**: Immutable Architectural Constraint  
**Created**: 2026-02-01  
**Context**: UX Specification

## Role Definitions

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/terminology.bead` (Member Roles section)

This section provides UX-focused summaries. For complete definitions, trust calculations, 
and edge cases, see the terminology bead.

### Operator
- Bot administrator who runs the bot as a service
- **Least Privilege**: Cannot manually execute membership changes
- Cannot change consensus thresholds without group vote
- Cannot override ejections or bypass protocol
- All operator actions auditable via `/audit operator`

### Members
- Fully vetted, trusted nodes IN the Stroma Signal group
- Must maintain ≥2 vouches from DIFFERENT CLUSTERS
- Trust Standing ≥ 0 (Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags)

**Sub-Types:**
- **Bridges**: Exactly 2 vouches (minimum requirement)
- **Validators**: 3+ vouches (high-trust, used for optimization)

### Invitees (Leaf Nodes)
- People OUTSIDE the Signal group being vetted
- Has 1 vouch from inviter, needs 1 more from different member
- Cannot vouch for others, cannot flag, cannot vote

### Bot
- Automated trust network facilitator
- Roles: Gatekeeper, Blind Matchmaker, Diplomat, Health Monitor
- All operations in 1-on-1 PMs (privacy-first)
- Never stores Signal IDs in cleartext

- `/invite @username [context]` - Invite someone (counts as first vouch)
- `/vouch @username` - Vouch for invitee or existing member

### Trust Management
- `/flag @username [reason]` - Flag member (required reason)

### Status Queries
- `/status` - Your trust standing
- `/mesh` - Network overview (trust + replication health)
- `/mesh strength` - DVR and vouch distribution
- `/mesh replication` - Replication health status
- `/mesh config` - Group configuration

### Configuration
- `/propose config <setting> <value>` - Signal group settings
- `/propose stroma <setting> <value>` - Stroma configuration
- `/propose federate <group-id>` - Federation proposal

### Audit

## Voting: Native Signal Polls

- ✅ Only aggregated results visible
- ❌ Reactions expose voters - NOT used

**Structure:**
- Options: Binary (Approve/Reject)
- Timeout: Configurable per proposal
- Threshold: From GroupConfig.config_change_threshold (% of votes to pass)
- Quorum: From GroupConfig.min_quorum (% of members who must vote)

---

## Network Health: Distinct Validator Ratio (DVR)

**Formula**: DVR = Distinct_Validators / (N / 4)

**Three-Tier Status:**
| Color | DVR Range | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 | 0-33% | Unhealthy |
| 🟡 | 33-66% | Developing |
| 🟢 | 66-100% | Healthy |

## Bot Voice & Personality

- **Natural Language**: Conversational, not technical jargon
- **Transparent**: Explains decisions in human terms
- **Proactive**: Suggests strategic introductions
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Never reveals identities or social graph
- **Non-Judgmental**: No shame or blame in trust decisions

## State Transitions

### Invitee → Bridge → Validator
- Invitee (1 vouch, outside group)
- Bridge (2 vouches, in group)
- Validator (3+ vouches, in group)

### Member → Ejected → Re-Entry
- Ejection: Standing < 0 OR Effective_Vouches < 2
- Re-entry: Secure 2 new vouches via /invite
- No cooldown period
