## Core Invariant

**Signal Group = Fully Vetted Members Only**

Every member in the Signal group has met the admission requirements. Invitees (being vetted) are OUTSIDE the group until fully admitted.

## Cross-Cluster Requirement

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/cross-cluster-requirement.bead`

| Role | Vouch Count | Cluster Requirement |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Bridge | 2 vouches | 2 different clusters |
| Validator | 3+ vouches | min(vouch_count, available_clusters) |

**Single-Cluster Exception**: When only 1 cluster exists (bootstrap or organic convergence), cross-cluster requirement is not enforced. Enforcement begins when `clusters >= 2`.

**Why Cross-Cluster**: Prevents coordinated infiltration. Same-cluster vouching allows bad actors to rubber-stamp each other.

---

## Bootstrap: Seed Group

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/bootstrap-seed.bead`

**One-time process** to create the initial 3-member seed group:

1. **Size**: 3 members (minimum for triangulation)
2. **Process**: Member-initiated via Signal commands (`/create-group`, `/add-seed`)
3. **Result**: Initial triangle with mutual vouches (each member has 2 vouches)
4. **Transition**: Bot becomes sole admin, all future admissions via protocol

**Key Constraint**: Operator does NOT manually add members. Bootstrap is member-initiated.

---

## Admission Protocol

### Phase 1: Invitation (First Vouch)

**Command**: `/invite @PotentialMember "Optional context"`

- Invitation counts as first vouch
- ANY Member can invite (Bridges and Validators)
- Invitee is OUTSIDE the group (waiting status)

**See**: `.beads/user-roles-ux.bead` for command details

### Phase 2: Strategic Matching (Blind Matchmaker)

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/blind-matchmaker-dvr.bead`

- Bot selects a member from DIFFERENT cluster than inviter
- Prioritizes DVR optimization (create distinct Validators)
- Falls back to MST algorithm if no DVR-optimal match

### Phase 3: Introduction Facilitation

- Bot creates 3-person Signal chat (invitee, selected member, bot)
- Selected member chats with invitee (human vetting)
- Selected member uses `/vouch @Invitee` to confirm

**Privacy**: Vetting happens in 1-on-1 PMs, not group chat.

### Phase 4: Admission

1. **Verify**: 2 vouches from different clusters (or Single-Cluster Exception)
2. **Record**: Push vouch records with ZK-proofs to Freenet contract
3. **Wait**: Freenet confirms state update
4. **Add**: Bot adds member to Signal group
5. **Announce**: Group notification (using hashes, not names)
6. **Delete**: Ephemeral vetting session data removed immediately

**See**: `.beads/freenet-contract-design.bead` for state structure

---

## Ejection Protocol

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/security-constraints.bead` (Section 2)

### Two Independent Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Standing < 0** | `Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags < 0` | Too many regular flags |
| **Effective_Vouches < 2** | Voucher left OR voucher flagged you | Below minimum threshold |

### Standing Calculation

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/terminology.bead` (Trust Calculations)

```
Voucher-Flaggers = All_Vouchers ∩ All_Flaggers
Effective_Vouches = |All_Vouchers| - |Voucher_Flaggers|
Regular_Flags = |All_Flaggers| - |Voucher_Flaggers|
Standing = Effective_Vouches - Regular_Flags
```

**Key Insight**: Voucher-flaggers are excluded from BOTH counts (prevents 2-point swings).

### No Grace Periods

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/security-constraints.bead` (Section 2)

- ❌ NO warnings before ejection
- ❌ NO re-verification windows
- ❌ NO delayed ejection
- ✅ Immediate ejection when threshold violated

**Rationale**: Grace periods create exploitable windows. See `.beads/philosophical-foundations.bead` for accountability vs. forgiveness duality.

## Edge Cases & Exceptions

### Cluster Depletion During Vetting

If a cluster is destroyed (members ejected) while an invitee is being vetted:
- Invitee's existing vouch(es) remain valid
- Bot must find a new member from a different remaining cluster
- If no other clusters exist, Single-Cluster Exception applies

### Re-Admission After Ejection

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/architectural-decisions-open.bead` (Decisions #1, #10)

Ejected members can be re-admitted through the normal admission process:

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Flags** | Previous flags persist (carried over from before ejection) |
| **Vouches** | Must secure 2+ new cross-cluster vouches from current members |
| **Standing** | New vouches - Previous flags |
| **Difficulty** | Higher bar if flagged (3 flags = need 4+ vouches for positive standing) |
| **Cooldown** | None - re-entry can happen immediately if vouches secured |

**Example**: Alice ejected with 3 flags needs 4+ vouches to re-enter with positive standing.

**Rationale**: Accountability over forgiveness for flag history. Community memory of concerns is preserved. See `.beads/philosophical-foundations.bead`.

## Internal Mesh-Building (Blind Matchmaker)

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/blind-matchmaker-dvr.bead`

**Purpose**: Suggest strategic cross-cluster introductions to improve network resilience.

**Priority Algorithm (DVR-Optimized):**

| Phase | Action | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Phase 0 (DVR)** | Suggest introductions that create Distinct Validators | Maximize independently-verified members |
| **Phase 1 (MST)** | If no DVR-optimal match, accept any cross-cluster vouch | Maintain admission flow |
| **Phase 2 (Islands)** | Bridge disconnected clusters | Ensure full connectivity |

**Health Metric**: Distinct Validator Ratio (DVR) = Distinct_Validators / (N / 4)

**See**: `.beads/mesh-health-metric.bead` for DVR calculation and three-tier health status (🔴 Unhealthy, 🟡 Developing, 🟢 Healthy).

---

## Continuous Health Monitoring

**Canonical Source**: `.beads/freenet-integration.bead` (State Stream)

### Real-Time State Stream (NOT Polling)

```rust
async fn membership_health_monitor(
    signal: &impl SignalClient,
    freenet: &impl FreenetClient,
) {
    let mut stream = freenet.subscribe_to_state_changes().await;
    
    while let Some(change) = stream.next().await {
        match change {
            StateChange::VouchRemoved { member, .. } |
            StateChange::FlagAdded { member, .. } => {
                let state = freenet.get_member_state(member).await;
                if state.effective_vouches < MIN_VOUCH_THRESHOLD {
                    signal.remove_member(member).await;
                }
                if state.standing < 0 {
                    signal.remove_member(member).await;
                }
            },
            _ => {}
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Use real-time Freenet state stream (react to `StateChange` events)
- ❌ DO NOT use polling with sleep loops
- ✅ Immediate ejection when either trigger activated

**See**: `.beads/testing-standards.bead` for integration testing patterns with mock Signal/Freenet.

## Key Architectural Principles

| Principle | Description | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Waiting Room = Outside Group** | Invitees are not in a separate chat; they're simply outside Signal group | `terminology.bead` |
| **Invitees = OUTSIDE Group** | 1 vouch, being vetted, cannot participate | `terminology.bead` |
| **Bridges = IN Group** | 2 vouches, minimum requirement for membership | `terminology.bead` |
| **Validators = IN Group** | 3+ vouches, used for Blind Matchmaker optimization only | `terminology.bead` |
| **Gatekeeper** | Bot strictly enforces 2-vouch requirement | `signal-integration.bead` |
| **Immediate Ejection** | No grace periods, no warnings | `security-constraints.bead` |
| **Vouch Permissions** | ANY Member can vouch (not restricted to Validators) | `security-constraints.bead` |
| **Flags Persist** | Ejected members keep their flag history on re-entry | `architectural-decisions-open.bead` |
| **No Permanent Bans** | Ejected members can always re-enter with sufficient vouches | `philosophical-foundations.bead` |

## Gastown Agent Instructions

**When implementing vetting/admission:**
1. Read `.beads/terminology.bead` for canonical definitions
2. Read `.beads/cross-cluster-requirement.bead` for enforcement logic
3. Read `.beads/security-constraints.bead` for ejection triggers
4. Use trait abstractions for Signal/Freenet (see `.beads/testing-standards.bead`)

**When implementing Blind Matchmaker:**
1. Read `.beads/blind-matchmaker-dvr.bead` for algorithm details
2. Read `.beads/mesh-health-metric.bead` for DVR calculation

**When implementing health monitoring:**
1. Use real-time Freenet state stream (NOT polling)
2. Check BOTH ejection triggers on every state change
3. Immediate action when threshold violated

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Restricting vouching to Validators only
- ❌ Adding grace periods or warnings before ejection
- ❌ Polling instead of state stream
- ❌ Storing Signal IDs in cleartext during vetting
- ❌ Persisting vetting session data after admission
