# Property-based testing configuration for Stroma
#
# Per testing-standards.bead § Property-Based Testing (CRITICAL):
# Property tests must run with increased case counts for security-critical code.
#
# Default proptest configuration is 256 cases per test.
# We increase to 1000 for critical paths (passphrase generation, trust logic, etc.)

[default]
# Number of test cases to run per property test
cases = 1000

# Maximum shrinking iterations when a failure is found
# Higher values help find minimal failing cases
max_shrink_iters = 10000

# Timeout per test case (in milliseconds)
# Set to 0 for no timeout
timeout = 0

# Fork mode for better isolation
# "true" = each case runs in a separate process (slower but more isolated)
# "false" = all cases run in same process (faster)
fork = false
