# Freenet dependencies temporarily commented out due to curve25519-dalek version conflict
# with Signal libraries. Signal uses a forked curve25519-dalek, freenet-stdlib uses crates.io.
# TODO: Resolve by either:
# 1. Patching freenet-stdlib to use Signal's fork
# 2. Waiting for upstream to align
# 3. Building freenet integration as separate binary
# freenet-stdlib = { version = "0.1.30", features = ["contract", "net"] }
# freenet-scaffold = "0.2.1"

# Signal integration (uses forked libsignal-service-rs with poll support)
# ❌ DO NOT USE: presage-store-sqlite (stores ALL messages - server seizure risk!)
# See: .beads/security-constraints.bead § 10, .cursor/rules/security-guardrails.mdc
presage = { git = "https://github.com/whisperfish/presage" }

# TODO: Add remaining dependencies during implementation
# - ZK-proofs (winterfell)
# - Crypto (ring, zeroize)
# - Async (tokio)
# - CLI (clap)
# - Serialization (serde, ciborium)

# Protocol v8 poll support via our fork of libsignal-service-rs
# Fork rebased on whisperfork branch (which presage uses)
# See: .beads/poll-implementation-gastown.bead
